More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, have urged 
artificial intelligence labs to pause development of the most advanced systems, 
warning in an open letter that A.I. tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.”

A.I. developers are “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more 
powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict 
or reliably control,” according to the letter, which the nonprofit Future of Life Institute 
released on Wednesday.

Others who signed the letter include Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple; Andrew Yang, 
an entrepreneur and a 2020 presidential candidate; and Rachel Bronson, the president of
 the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which sets the Doomsday Clock.
